# Day 6 HW Questions

1. x should be a double in the integrand because we used decimal intrements to calculate said integral. The return should be a double for the same reason.

2. a and b (our range) should be doubles because of our decimal increments but npoints should be an integer. The return would be a double. 

3. Our integrand is evaluated from 0.0 to 1.0

4. At 110 boxes, the value starts to converge to the original pi value (in terms of 4 decimal places).

# Discussion Question

1. The Monte Carlo method seems optimal for data sets that do not have clearly defined/assigned functions and it would be a great way to visualize that data and draw equations/models from it. Riemann sums allow us to give efficient values for functions that are clearly defined.
